#### **Testing and Debugging**  


To test, I:  
1. Installed http-server using(npm install -g http-server) and then Ran `http-server` and opened `http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.html`.  
2. Uploaded `DummyNTuple.bin` and checked if the parsed data matched the expected output.  
3. Tried uploading invalid files (e.g., text files, corrupted binaries) to ensure errors like *"Invalid Magic Number"* or *"Checksum Mismatch"* were shown.
